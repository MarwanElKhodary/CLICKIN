# Frontend Documentation

## Commands

- Commands to get running:
  - `npm install`
  - `npm run start`

## Notes

- Base structure is from [here](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate)
- Base the design somewhat on [this](https://everyuuid.com/)
- Debating just using HTMX based on [this setup](https://community.aws/content/2hYjbCwWyM3KAuR77j9DqE1P4p7/deploying-a-go-application-with-htmx-to-aws-elastic-beanstalk-a-step-by-step-guide?lang=en)
- This current commit works with [this solution](https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx/issues/779) but is super ugly and I still don't understand cors and how this is supposed to actually work - I kinda like HTMX tho
  - Need to understand more about why this error is occuring and why I need this
